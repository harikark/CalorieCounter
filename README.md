# Calorie Counter
A random counter trigger function used a hypothethical calorie counter for displayed chocolates. 

HTML dynamically updated with the use of jQuery and styled with CSS/  Bootstrap. 

This is a game using numbers, similar to the game hangman, but instead of letters the player will guess with numbers. There will be four chocolates displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a chocolates it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
The amount of points each chocolates adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each chocolates is clicked.
The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the chocolates will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
